# VSCode-Python-FIles

Hello there, I'm Ryan! I learned how to write python scripts over the summer for my biology research lab (Dr. Gregorio), 
and these are the python programs that I am working on so far. I'd say 3/4 of them are for Dr. Gregorio's lab and the rest
are just random projects I think are fun.

If you are a fellow student at University of Arizona, and you are interested in doing cool stuff I'd love the opportunity 
to work together @ ryanbowser@arizona.edu (im new to cs, so be warned lol).



Hope you enjoy my scripts! ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ

-Ryan
